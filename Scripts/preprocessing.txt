Pre Processing in ArcGIS Pro for speed/ease of cleaning

Road Density:

Tried in GRASS:
- lines to points
    - v.to.points -i --overwrite input=roads@PERMANENT type=line output=points_on_road@PERMANENT use=vertex dmax=1
- Creating road density dataset
    - v.kernel input=points_on_road output=road_density radius=5000 multiplier=1000000
    - r.li.patchdensity --overwrite input=road_rast@PERMANENT config=config output=road_density
In ArcGIS Pro:
- ran line density tool on ArcGIS Pro - for NC, it ran for 3 days and 4 hours

Building Density:
Need to differentiate between number of buildings per unit area and area covered by builZing footprints

In ArcGIS Pro:
Number buildings per unit area:
- polygon to point
- calculate density

Area covered by building footprints:
- JSON to features
- New area field
- Calculate geometry (area)
- Spatial Join (1 to 1 summing building area within census blocks)
- new field
- calculate field total building area/ census block area
